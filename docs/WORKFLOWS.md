## Workflow Development Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names with version numbers
2. **Documentation**: Each workflow should have clear documentation
3. **Version Control**: Export workflows as JSON to `workflows/` directory
4. **Testing**: Test workflows thoroughly before deploying to production

## Workflow Storage

- Workflows are stored as JSON files in the `workflows/` directory
- Each workflow file should be named: `workflow-name-v1.json`
- Keep workflows organized and documented
